## New features in Taskbar 5.0

### Desktop icons

Taskbar now allows you to place icons on your desktop when set as your home screen!

Simply long-press the wallpaper on your home screen to get started.  Select "Add icon to desktop" from the context menu, then select an app from the list to add it to your desktop.

Long-pressing the desktop and selecting "Move icons" will allow you to rearrange your icons.  Press the checkmark button in the lower-right hand corner to lock the desktop back into place.  You can also select "Sort icons by name" to auto-arrange your icons for you.

* PLEASE NOTE: If freeform mode is enabled, desktop icons will only be available if your device is running Android 10 or later.  This is due to technical limitations in how Google has implemented freeform mode on earlier Android versions.

### Status icons & clock on the recent apps tray

Taskbar now includes a status area and clock on the recent apps tray!  Now you can quickly check your battery, network status, and the time and date, all on the corner of your screen.

You can enable this option by going to the "Recent apps" section of Taskbar's settings, and enabling the "Expand area with whitespace" and "Show status icons and clock" options.

Note that this area will not display while Taskbar is in the vertical orientation.

### Custom start button image

You can now customize the start button image beyond the previous "App drawer" and "Taskbar logo" options.  Want to display the Windows logo on your start button instead?  No problem!

Change your start button image by going to the "Appearance" section of Taskbar's settings, and setting the "Start button image" option to "Custom".  The system file picker will appear; just select the image you want to use and you're set!

### Larger start menu on tablets

When the start menu layout is set to "Grid", Taskbar's start menu will now expand to fill either three, four, or five columns, depending on the size of your device's screen, taking better advantage of screen real-estate and helping you locate the apps you want to launch faster.

### New transitions when launching apps

Taskbar will now scale apps onto the screen from their icons as it launches them, for some visual pizazz!

### Better default options

On a fresh Taskbar install, a few of the default settings have now changed.  For example, Taskbar now ships out-of-the-box with a more contrasty color scheme, as well as a faster refresh rate for the recent apps tray.

#### Plus, lots of bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements!
